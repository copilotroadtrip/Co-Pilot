# Co-Pilot

**Co-Pilot** is a full stack application that allows users who are road tripping to keep track of all the cities and towns they
will encounter on their journey. Information regarding the weather, distance, and time is displayed between each city. And upon 
clicking a particular city users can find hotel, gas, food, and google maps information. 

The Co-Pilot back end can be found [here](https://github.com/copilotroadtrip/CoPilotBackend).



## Tech Stack

* The front end was built in Javascript with React-Native. Jest/Enzyme were used for testing and Expo was used as a simulator
